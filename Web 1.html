        <pre>
            
            It took one look
            And forever lay out in front of me
            One smile, then I died
            Only to be revived by you

            There I was
            Thought I had everything figured out
            Goes to show just how much I know
            'Bout the way life plays out
            
            I take one step away
            Then I find myself coming back to you
            My one and only
            One and only you
            Ooh

            Now I know
            That I know not a thing at all
            Except the fact that I am yours
            And that you are mine
            Oh

            They told me that this wouldn't be easy
            And no
            I'm not one to complain

            I take one step away
            Then I find myself coming back to you
            My one and only
            One and only

            I take one step away
            Then I find myself coming back to you
            My one and only
            One and only you
        </pre>
